This is a Prime bot and these are it's instructions(I am not good at writing instructions)
1. You must know that Prime will always ask your Folder loaction meaning like C://Users//This Name you have to give This Name to continue.
2. Create a password for your own safety.
3. Give it a name yes it will not always be Prime you can change the name by writeing ( change name ) or ( change name _____) but you have to give the passwordto change it.
4. Same with the password.
5. you can only use the command random movies only if a d: drive is connected
6. And browsing is an always feature nowadays so why not and you do it with using the browse feature.
Those are the main intrsuctions In future versions maybe I am going to implement the C drive feature or anything else.
